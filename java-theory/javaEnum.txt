1. Enum in java is a data type that contains fixed set of constants.
2.The java enum constants are static and final implicitly.
3. enum can have fields, constructors and methods.
4. enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it
 internally extends Enum class.
5. The enum can be defined within or outside the class because it is similar to a class.
6. Constructor of enum type is private. If you don't declare private compiler 
internally creates private constructor.


7. Can we create the instance of enum by new keyword?
    = No, because it contains private constructors only.

8. Can we have abstract method in enum?
Yes, ofcourse! we can have abstract methods and can provide the implementation of
 these methods

9.What is the purpose of values() method in enum?
The java compiler internally adds the values() method when it creates an enum. The values() method returns an array containing all the values of the enum.
